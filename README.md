# PassProtect

> [!WARNING]
> This project reached EOL and wont receive any further updates<br>
> The reason for this is a fatal data loss on my end due to a hardware defect<br>
> PassProtect doesn't make any backups on its own and runs completely locally<br>
> The new version that was WIP will not be continued because there are better alternatives<br>

> [!NOTE]
> If you are looking for an open source password manager take a look at one of these:<br>
> Bitwarden, KeePass, Vaultwarden<br>
> My personal recommendation is 1Password although it is not free nor open source


PassProtect is an easy-to-use password manager that does not require any internet connection.<br/>
All your data is locked inside a file which is encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)<br/>
and are only accessible through your master password.<br/>
It is recommended to choose a sentence as your master password,<br/>
because they are long, easy to remember and hard to crack with brute force.<br/>
You can also define a hint for yourself in case you forget your password anyway.<br/>
(Do not make the hint too obvious)<br/>
To make PassProtect even more secure, there is a delay after every failed login attempt which gets longer with every
try<br/>
PassProtect even offers the possibility to change the look and feel to numerous themes based on your system<br/>
When you let your password unchanged for a long time, PassProtect reminds you to change your password<br/>
For a faster login, PassProtect offers you the ability to add your phone as login method<br/>
(only compatible with android phones)

## Existing features

PassProtect offers you the possibility to safely store documents, totp codes (2fa) and Passwords<br/>
With the integrated 2fa feature, you won't have to rely on a smartphone anymore,<br/>
the upside of this is, the codes are stored in a much safer way and locked behind a master-password.<br/>
