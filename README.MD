# PassProtect
<p>PassProtect is an easy-to-use password manager that does not require any internet connection.</p>
<p>All your passwords are locked inside a file which is encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)<br>and are only accessible through your master password.</p>
<p>It is recommended to choose a sentence as your master password,<br>because they are long, easy to remember and hard to crack with brute force.</p>
<p>You can also define a hint for yourself in case you forget your password anyway.<br>(Do not make the hint too obvious)</p>
